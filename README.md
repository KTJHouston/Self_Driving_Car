# Self_Driving_Car
Creating a 2D environment for a car to learn to drive in using Tensorflow

Current State: Running Main will allow the user to drive a car using WASD. 
There is no AI driver at this time.

Next Steps: Implement a "Vision" system, in which the Driver gets a list 
of numbers indicating distance from the nearest object. These numbers 
can potentially be passed to a neural net as inputs.
