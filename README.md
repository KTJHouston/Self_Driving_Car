# Self_Driving_Car
Creating a 2D environment for a car to learn to drive in using Tensorflow. 
Inspired by Code Bullet, but not using any of his code.

#### Current State: 
Running Main will allow the user to drive a car using WASD. 
Hit 'space' to reset the cars position and the reward gates. 
There is no AI driver at this time. 

#### Next Steps: 

1. Build a neural net to learn to navigate the track.
